# IMAGE CAPTIONING

Image captioning is described as "automatically creating the textual description for an image using an artificial intelligence-based system." The purpose of such a system is to turn a given input image into textual or Natural Language-based description.

The above example is enough to understand image captioning. <br />
Generation of captions is a challenging artificial intelligence problem where a textual description must be generated for a given photograph.
It requires methods both from computer vision to understand the content of an image and a language model from the field of natural language processing to turn the understanding of the image into words in the right order.
This is also a very active area of research and an interesting multi modal topic where combination of both image and text processing is used to build a useful Deep Learning application, aka Image Captioning.
